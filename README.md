# Time Series Analysis
*A set of Jupyter notebooks developed for time series analysis.*

### Requirements
-----------
 - Python 3.8.0
 - matplotlib==3.3.4
 - numpy==1.19.5
 - pandas==1.4.2
 - scikit-learn==0.24.1

## Overview
-----------
The notebooks generally aims to cover various time series models (specification, properties, how to estimate parameters, generate forecasts) and various statistical tests. It covers the following topics:
1. Looking at data
2. Combining series
3. Filtering
4. Identifying stationarity
5. ACF and PACF
6. AR models
7. White noise properties
8. Check roots
9. Check residuals are white noise
10. ADF / Unit root test
11. KPSS test
12. MA and ARMA models
13. ARMAX model
14. VAR models
15. Causality analysis and Granger causality
16. Granger casuality tests
17. Impulse response analysis
18. Variance decomposition
19. Nonstationary models: cointegration testing
20. VECM models
21. Volatility modelling and GARCH models
22. Testing for time-varying variance
